# Twitter Blocking Tools
_A short list of tools for improving the Twitter experience_

## App: Secateur

Free to use, the app can block all the followers of accounts with less than 50k followers.

## Extension: Red Block
Red Block is free browser extension that can block imported lists or followers of a specific account (limited to blocking smaller batches of 500 accounts at a time).  
**Notice: blocking too many accts in a 15 min interval will cause you to be automatically logged out of Twitter.**
