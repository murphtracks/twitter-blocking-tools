# Twitter Blocking Tools
_A short list of tools for improving the Twitter experience_

### Tweet Beaver | Home of Really Useful Twitter Tools
Use Tweet Beaver to pull friend and follower lists for accounts to use in conjunction with blocking tools:

### Extension: RedBlock
Redblock is free browser extension that can block lists or followers of an account but it can only block 500 at a time (effective for daily use); I have not tested the other API functions mentioned in link below.  
**Notice: blocking too many accts in a 15 min interval will cause you to be automatically logged out.**

### App: BlockDezNat
Free, has a bunch of pre-listed DezNat account on a block list.
First sign up on the main site:  
https://blockdnat.org/  
Then subscribe to this list:

### App: Block Party 
Block Party is good, schedule batches of 5k at a time, you can schedule multiple batches to run and it auto blocks them for you **BUT requires a cc for free trial, costs after the trial.**  
Also requires MFA via number or authentication app.
